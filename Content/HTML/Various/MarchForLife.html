                                   <span class="quote">I believe that the March For Life was more than just a march or a cause.  It was a life changing event for me.  My thoughts about abortion were that it was wrong, unless the mother was raped.  But now that I have learned a whole lot about abortion and the true meaning of life on this trip, I am against it all the way.  There were so many people there that I was speechless!  From the chants about Obama, to the groups with the matching outfits.  It was all eye opening.  I would do it all again if  I had too!!  It was definitely an experience that I won't forget.<br />

                                   <span class="quote">My favorite part of the trip was the March for Life and seeing all the young kids participating in such a huge event.  Also, I liked being part of the Church Mass and seeing what it is like and seeing all the people that took part in it.<br /> - Austin Hamilton<br /><br />

                                   <span class="quote">I was initially shocked at the rally by the high percentage of Catholics because I have always lived in an area where Catholics are the minority.  Then at the March, I was touched by the spirit and enthusiasm displayed by all the groups.  I was also impressed with how beautiful the Basilica was.  This trip was an eye-opening experience that left a lasting impression.  I would highly recommend this trip to everyone.<br /> - Stephen Brown<br /><br /></span>
